        Hello! my name is Lizzy (aka Bizzle) and I make decorated penpal cards and letters I've been penpalling since 2020, 
        i started to try to make friends during quarantine, and have continued this hobby to connect with people all over the uk. 
        I make a lot of cards for friends and families birthdays as i feel handmade cards are so much more sincere and personal. 
        i mostly work with pastel colours and am heavily influenced by japanese and korean aesthetics and stationery. 
        I also journal about my interests, for example genshin impact, kpop anime and much more!
